<h1>About Don't Be A Jerk</h1>
<p>2017 was a tough year politically and tensions got out of hand occassionally. This socially-conscious petition, albeit playful, encourages us to remember that we can <i>respectfully</i> agree to disagree without escalating to higher decibel. Users are free to sign, remove their signature, view other signees of the petition, and read more about the issue. Here's hoping that with enough support, this issue...won't be an issue in 2018 and onward.</p>
